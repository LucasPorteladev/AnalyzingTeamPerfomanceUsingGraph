# Analyzing Team Performance Using Graph Theory Metrics

This repository contains the research paper *"Analyzing Team Performance Using Graph Theory Metrics"*, which explores the application of graph theory in football analytics. The study investigates the structural differences between championship-winning and relegated teams in La Liga by constructing player similarity networks and applying various network metrics.

## Abstract

In modern football analytics, understanding the factors that drive team success is crucial. This research models teams as player similarity graphs, where nodes represent players and weighted edges quantify performance similarities. By leveraging centrality and connectivity measures such as degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, and PageRank, the study identifies key structural differences between successful and underperforming teams. The findings reveal that championship teams exhibit more cohesive network structures, whereas relegated teams often rely on a few key players, exposing strategic vulnerabilities. The insights derived from this analysis can inform tactical planning, recruitment strategies, and team performance optimization.
